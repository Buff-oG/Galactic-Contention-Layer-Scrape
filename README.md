<h1>How does it work?</h1>

This file was added to help SquadJS bot to fetch the proper information about the Galactic Contention Level/Layers/Teams/Subfactions. To adhere a better environment and uniformity with SquadJS, we've created a JSON file containing all the necessary data. We will maintain this JSON file whenever we do modifications and/or update Galactic Contention.

This json is very similar to the vanilla Squad Layers JSON output. However, ours contain less data for now.

_This our duty as Galactic Contention developers to maintain this json with our internal data scrapper via our editor widget_
